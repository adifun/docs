Let's assume we have a dataframe named `df` with the following columns: `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Occupation`, `Salary`, `Country`, `City`.\n\nFirst, we need to analyze the dataframe to understand the content and distribution of values in each column. We can use the `describe()` function in pandas to get a summary of the dataframe.\n\n```python\ndf.describe(include='all')\n```\n\nThis will give us a summary of each column including count, unique, top, frequency for categorical columns and count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max for numerical columns.\n\nNext, we need to check for empty values in each column. We can use the `isnull()` function in pandas to do this.\n\n```python\ndf.isnull().sum()\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of empty values in each column.\n\nNow, let's create the documentation in markdown tabular format. We will order the columns by importance based on the analysis we did above. For example, if the `Country` column has all the same values, we will de-prioritize its importance.\n\n| Column | Description | Distribution of Values | Number of Empty Values | Sample Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Name | The name of the individual | Names are unique for each individual | 0 | John Doe |\n| Age | The age of the individual | Ages range from 20 to 65 with a mean of 35 | 0 | 30 |\n| Gender | The gender of the individual | 60% Male, 40% Female | 0 | Male |\n| Occupation | The occupation of the individual | Various occupations with 'Engineer' being the most common | 0 | Engineer |\n| Salary | The salary of the individual | Salaries range from $30,000 to $100,000 with a mean of $60,000 | 0 | $50,000 |\n| City | The city where the individual lives | Various cities with 'New York' being the most common | 0 | New York |\n| Country | The country where the individual lives | All individuals live in the USA | 0 | USA |\n\nThis table provides a concise summary of the dataframe, highlighting the important features of each column. It also provides information on the distribution of values and the number of empty values in each column, which can be useful for further data analysis.
